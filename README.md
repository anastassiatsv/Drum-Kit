## Challenge #1 - Drum Kit 

### 

The idea behind this first project is to imitate the functionality of a keyboard. Through audio tags we will allow the user to reproduce up to 9 different sounds.

When a user presses a key that matches one of the letters displayed in the `div` elements, the page should play the corresponding soundclip and place a temporary 'highlight' (or border) around the `div`

* find the KeyCode of each key on [keycode.info](https://keycode.info/)
